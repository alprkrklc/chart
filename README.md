## Simple Chart Module Using Matplotlib
I've created a simple chart module to create simple and customizable charts to compare different datasets of a common object. You can check `chart.py` and `axes.py` to see how it works and `example.py` to see a simlpe demonstration.

## Requirements
- You can see all the required libraries in `requirements.txt` file. You can install them all at once via `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
